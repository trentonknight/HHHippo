# Instructions

You're playing a game of Hungry Hungry Hippos with 3 other people. Every round, player 0 will eat 3 pellets, player 1 will eat 4 pellets, player 2 will eat 6 pellets, and player 3 will eat 1 pellet, in that order. The game ends when there are 0 pellets left.

Write a method that takes in the starting number of pellets, and return an array containing which turn the game ends on, and which player eats the last pellet.

**Example**

```js
hippo(1) => [1, 0]
hippo(9) => [1, 2]
hippo(19) => [2, 1]
```
